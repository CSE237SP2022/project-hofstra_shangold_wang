## Text Acceptor Branch
What user stories were completed this iteration? I completed a class that uses the Scanner class to take in a text input and output into a usable Array List format, with each argument having one spot in the list.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? make methods that need to be implemented to better streamline the output class process (not sure what methods those will be until we make more progress on how to output the note).

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? I don't think so.


## Statistics Branch

## Start Script
What user stories were completed this iteration? I'm currently developing a bash script that will start/run the java program from the command line

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? finish creating/developing the classes so that the script can be tested effectively.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? Yes, the script is not yet functional.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line? The `javac -d` and `java -cp` commands are in the script. We are still not yet sure if we're going to implement other commands via the script.
