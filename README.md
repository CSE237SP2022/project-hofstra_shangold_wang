## Text Acceptor Branch
What user stories were completed this iteration? I completed a class that uses the Scanner class to take in a text input and output into a usable Array List format, with each argument having one spot in the list.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? make methods that need to be implemented to better streamline the output class process (not sure what methods those will be until we make more progress on how to output the note).

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? I don't think so.


## Player-deck-helper-methods Branch
What user stories were completed this iteration? Helper methods were made to help with game functionality. This includes methods to check if a player has a given card and methods to take cards from another player or the main deck. Methods were also made to determine when a player has a full set of any card number or if any deck is out of cards.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? Methods can be added for a computer player to automate parts of a turn. This would allow users to play both against other players or against the computer.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? No, I believe everything works currently.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line? None



## HeaderGenerator Branch
What user stories were completed this iteration? I'm currently working on appending to the array list to add a generated header based on used input. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? Add more methods to made the header more comprehensive and customizable.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? Yes, there are problems in the path with my tests which is an error I haven't seen before so I'm working on fixing that now.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line? None


## Start Script
What user stories were completed this iteration? I'm currently developing a bash script that will start/run the java program from the command line

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? finish creating/developing the classes so that the script can be tested effectively.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? Yes, the script is not yet functional.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line? The `javac -d` and `java -cp` commands are in the script. We are still not yet sure if we're going to implement other commands via the script.
