# Overall info for Iteration 2 (was note creator app, now changed to go fish app)
Update the README.txt file in your repository with the following information:

## What user stories were completed this iteration? 
We worked on the the go fish game during this iteration. More specifically, we developed a Player object; a class that keeps track of the Player's deck of cards and alters them when needed; a class that updates the Player's points when there exists a set of three of the same cards in the Player's deck; and a class that calls all of these other classes and methods to actually run the program.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? 
We intend to make a Computer player object, as right now there can only be human-user players. Also, we want to add different game functionality and have the user decide how many players can play the game, as right now, only two players can play at a time.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? 
No
## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
Just call the script!:)

## go-fish-script Branch

## play-game Branch

## player Branch

## shuffle_deck Branch

## update-points-when-sets




## Player-deck-helper-methods Branch
What user stories were completed this iteration? Helper methods were made to help with game functionality. This includes methods to check if a player has a given card and methods to take cards from another player or the main deck. Methods were also made to determine when a player has a full set of any card number or if any deck is out of cards.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? Methods can be added for a computer player to automate parts of a turn. This would allow users to play both against other players or against the computer.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? No, I believe everything works currently.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line? None
