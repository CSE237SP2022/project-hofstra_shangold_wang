## Text Acceptor Branch
What user stories were completed this iteration? I completed a class that uses the Scanner class to take in a text input and output into a usable Array List format, 
with each argument having one spot in the list.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration? make methods that need to be implemented to better streamline the output class process (not sure 
what methods those will be until we make more progress on how to output the note).

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work? I don't think so.
